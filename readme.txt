Quick start
===========

It is easy to get started with qooxdoo. For detailed information please
see http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.8#getting_started

For the impatient, here is a short version:

Use the 'tool/bin/create-application.py' script to start a new application,
This will create a minimal application directory structure, which is ready to 
be built and run. Within the newly created application run the command 
'generate.py source', in order to build a development version of your app. 
Open 'source/index.html' in your browser to startup the application. You can 
then go on and extend it into an application of your liking, by changing the
'source/class/<namespace>/Application.js' source file.


API Reference
=============

You might also want to open the API viewer in a separate browser window,
which offers the qooxdoo framework API in a convenient way (See the
top-level 'index.html' file next to the README.txt).
