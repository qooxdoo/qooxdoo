%{Website}
*******************

You use %{Website} to build light-weight, integrated, low-level components for web sites or other browser-like environments where you don't want to add graphical elements with qooxdoo. It features a DOM selector engine (Sizzle), BOM and HTML abstraction layers, and cross-browser keyboard and mouse events. As it does not contain visual elements, it is independent of image resources and theming. Its code can be shrink-wrapped into a single %{JS} file, and is available as an individual download. You can include it like any other %{JS} library in your projects.

This section provides tutorials and introductory material. For your daily work with %{Website} the only other thing you need is the `API reference <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/website-api>`__.
