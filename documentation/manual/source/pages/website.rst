Website
*******************

You use qooxdoo Website to build light-weight, integrated, low-level components for web sites or other browser-like environments where you don't want to add graphical elements with qooxdoo. It features a DOM selector engine (Sizzle), BOM and HTML abstraction layers, and a cross-browser keyboard and mouse events. As it does not contain visual elements, it is independent of image resources and theming. Its code can be shrink-wrapped into a single %{JS} file, and is available as an individual download. You can include it like any other %{JS} library in your projects. 

.. note::
  Sections referenced below are outdated and do not reflect the current implementation. To get an idea of where %{Website} is heading, please refer to the API docs of `qx.module <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.module>`__.

This section provides tutorials and introductory material. For your daily work with qooxdoo Website the only other thing you need is the `API reference <http://api.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/>`_.
