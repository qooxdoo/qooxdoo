Introduction
============

NOTE: This is a new feature in Qooxdoo which is disabled by default until Qooxdoo v6 because it is a "breaking change"; for most applications however, it will be safe to turn it on and get free memory management, but you should read this page first to understand what the changes are and how they might affect your application.  You can enable this feature by specifying the "qx.automaticMemoryManagement" as "true" in your applications config.json  

Generally, qooxdoo's runtime will take care of most of the issues around object disposal, so you don't have to be too anxious if you get those 'missing destruct declaration' messages from a verbose disposer run.

Normally, JavaScript automatically cleans up. There is a built-in garbage collector in all engines, and while there were bugs in browsers like IE6, this is no longer the case.  In Qooxdoo v6.0 and later, almost all objects can be disposed automatically. 

The principal of using garbage collection for managing objects instead of explicitly .dispose()ing them is that destructors and dispose() methods are not implemented.  This is important for many reasons, the principal being that the Javascript garbage collector does not notify us when an object is about to be collected.

But this does not mean that objects can’t have startup and shutdown procedures - many do in fact, it’s just that cycle is (or should be) separate to garbage collection.  

Historically, a common pattern in Qooxdoo classes is to use dispose/destructor as a general purpose shutdown, so if we want to move to automatic garbage collection we need to identify those classes which have a special shutdown procedure so that the calling code can respect that and free up resources.  We could take the view that all destructor/dispose methods mean that the class has special shutdown procedures but this is unnecessarily harsh because there are a lot of classes which have trivial destructor implementations, or can be easily refactored to not have a destructor.

The difficulty here is in making it clear and obvious what needs to be disposed, and I’ve taken two approaches: first, each class which needs to be disposed implements the marker interface qx.core.IDisposable.  Every Object which implements that interface will be registered with ObjectRegistry exactly as before, so that it can be identified for debugging purposes.  This has the side effect that fromHashCode will also work for those objects, and that the classes can be identified reliably via reflection and (potentially) in the API viewer.

Secondly, many destructors simply set member variables to null and these have been removed.  This is because they are unnecessary and by not providing one we make it clear that it is not necessary.

Thirdly, in some rare cases the code has been refactored to avoid the need for a destructor where previously there was one - for example, only adding a listener for the duration of the task and removing at the end of the task, instead of keeping the listener until dispose is called.  Except in one or two places I have avoided this approach because the risk of introducing bugs with rash, unfocused changes is high.

In many cases, the destructors are for classes which are typically used as singletons and need not be tracked - for example the various qx.event.handler.* and qx.event.dispatch.* classes.

There is one remaining global list of objects which could benefit from refactoring - qx.data.SingleValueBinding keeps a global lookup of every bound object, so any listeners to or from an object property will prevent that object from being garbage collected.  This could be modified so that the bindings are stored with the object, rather than in a global list indexed by hash code, but note that even when binding a single property, the target object also has links back to the source object; this means that unless both source and target are unbound, the binding will prevent garbage collection of both objects.

The net effect of this patch is that automatic garbage collection is now possible, with the proviso that (a) if you must release any bindings manually, and (b) you must observe any “shutdown” requirements of classes.

.. _pages/memory_management#disposing_an_application:

Disposing an application
========================

You can look at the dispose behaviour of your app if you set the disposer into a verbose mode and then invoke it deliberately while your app is running. This will usually render your app unusable, but you will get all those messages hinting you at object properties that might need to be looked after. How-To instructions can be found :ref:`here <pages/memory_management#how_to_test_the_destructor>`. But mind that the disposer output contains only hints, that still need human interpretation.

.. _pages/memory_management#example_destructor:

Example destructor
==================

::

    destruct : function()
    {
      this._data = this._moreData = null;
      this._disposeObjects("_buttonOk", "_buttonCancel");
      this._disposeArray("_children");
      this._disposeMap("_registry");
    }

* ``_disposeObjects``: Supports multiple arguments. Dispose the objects (qooxdoo objects) under each key and finally delete the key from the instance.
* ``_disposeArray``: Disposes the array under the given key, but disposes all entries in this array first. It must contain instances of qx.core.Object only.
* ``_disposeMap``: Disposes the map under the given key, but disposes all entries in this map first. It must contain instances of qx.core.Object only.

.. _pages/memory_management#how_to_test_the_destructor:

How to test the destructor
==========================

The destructor code allows you an in-depth analysis of the destructors and finds fields which may leak etc. The DOM tree gets also queried for back-references to qooxdoo instances. These checks are not enabled by default because of the time they need on each unload of a typical qooxdoo based application.

To enable these checks you need to select a variant and configure a setting.

The environment setting ``qx.debug`` must be ``true``. The setting ``qx.debug.dispose.level`` must be at least at ``1`` to show not disposed qooxdoo objects if they need to be deleted. A setting of ``2`` will additionally show non qooxdoo objects. Higher values mean more output. Don't be alarmed if some qooxdoo internal showing up. Usually there is no need to delete all references. `Garbage collection <http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3411#c2>`_ can do much for you here. For a general analysis ``1`` should be enough, a value of ``2`` should be used to be sure you did not miss anything. You can use the following code to adapt your ``config.json``:

::

    {
      "jobs" :
      {
        // existing jobs ...
        "source-disposerDebug" :
        {
          "desc" : "source version with 'qx.debug.dispose.level' for destruct support",

          "extend" : [ "source" ],

          "environment" :
          {
             "qx.debug.dispose.level" : "2"
          }
        }
      }
    }


This snippet is also available at the `Support for finding potential memory leaks <http://qooxdoo.org/docs/general/snippets#support_for_finding_potential_memory_leaks>`_ .

Log output from these settings could look something like this:

::

    35443 DEBUG: testgui.Report[1004]: Disposing: [object testgui.Report]FireBug.js (line 75)
    Missing destruct definition for '_scroller' in qx.ui.table.pane.FocusIndicator[1111]: [object qx.ui.table.pane.Scroller]Log.js (line 557)
    Missing destruct definition for '_lastMouseDownCell' in qx.ui.table.pane.Scroller[1083]: [object Object]Log.js (line 557)
    036394 DEBUG: testgui.Form[3306]: Disposing: [object testgui.Form]FireBug.js (line 75)
    Missing destruct definition for '_dateFormat' in qx.ui.component.DateChooserButton[3579]: [object qx.util.format.DateFormat]Log.js (line 557)
    Missing destruct definition for '_dateFormat' in qx.ui.component.DateChooserButton[3666]: [object qx.util.format.DateFormat]Log.js (line 557)

The nice thing here is that the log messages already indicate which dispose method to use: Every *"Missing destruct..."* line contains a hint to the type of member that is not being disposed properly, in the *"[object ...]"* part of the line. As a rule of thumb

* native Javascript types (Number, String, Object, ...) usually don't need to be disposed.
* for qooxdoo objects (e.g. qx.util.format.DateFormat, testgui.Report, ...) use ``_disposeObjects``
* for arrays or maps of qooxdoo objects use ``_disposeArray`` or ``_disposeMap``.
* be sure to cut all references to the DOM because garbage collection can not dispose object still connected to the DOM. This is also true for event listeners for example.

.. _pages/memory_management#finding_memory_leaks:

Finding memory leaks
====================

qooxdoo contains a built-in dispose profiling feature that finds undisposed objects. This is useful mainly for applications that create and destroy objects as needed during their lifetime (instead of creating them once and re-using them). It cannot be used to find undisposed objects left over after the application was shut down.

Dispose profiling works by disabling a feature in qooxdoo's Object Registry where the hash codes used to identify objects are reused. That way, it is possible to iterate over all objects created between two specified points in the application's lifecycle and check if they're disposed. Since hash reusing is a performance feature, dispose profiling should only be activated for the development version of an application.
It is activated by enabling the **qx.debug.dispose** environment setting for a compile job, e.g. `source-script`:

::

  "source-script" :
  {
    "environment" :
    {
      "qx.debug.dispose" : true
    }
  }

After building the application, the dispose debugging workflow is as follows:

* Call `qx.dev.Debug.startDisposeProfiling <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.dev.Debug~startDisposeProfiling>`_ before the code you wish to debug is executed. This effectively sets a marker saying "ignore any objects created before this point in time".
* Execute the code to be debugged, e.g. create a view component, then destroy it.
* Call `qx.dev.Debug.stopDisposeProfiling <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.dev.Debug~stopDisposeProfiling>`_. It will return a list of maps containing references to the undisposed objects as well as stack traces taken at the time the objects were registered, which makes it easy to find where in the code they were instantiated. Go through the list and add ``destroy`` and/or ``dispose`` calls to the application as needed.
