Unit Testing
************

qooxdoo comes with its own, nicely integrated unit testing environment and the corresponding application called `Testrunner <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/testrunner>`_. While being similar to JSUnit, the solution that ships with the qooxdoo SDK does not require any additional software. 

If you look at the component section of a qooxdoo distribution, you will find the Test Runner tailored to test the functionality of the qooxdoo *framework*. It provides a convenient interface to test classes that have been written to that end. You can run single tests, or a whole suite of them at once.

But the Test Runner framework can be deployed for your *own application*. It provides a GUI, a layer of infrastructure and a certain interface for arbitrary test classes. You can write your own test classes and take advantage of the Test Runner environment.
