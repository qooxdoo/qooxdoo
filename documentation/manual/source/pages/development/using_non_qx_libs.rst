Using non-qooxdoo, third-party libraries
*****************************************

Aside from normal qooxdoo libraries like contributions there may be times when you want to include a third-party %{JS} library in your application that just comes as a (potentially minified) *.js* file. (This could e.g. be a graphics or charting library.) There are basically two ways to integrate such a library into your application:

- Using the third-party library like a resource of your app.
- Wrapping the third-party code in an own %{qooxdoo} library.

Here is how each of them works.

Using the third-party library like a resource of your application
==================================================================

Let's assume you found this wonderful %{JS} library for charting, called *PonyCharts*. It is available as minified *ponycharts.js* download from the project's web site. It exposes an API for creating and manipulating charts, and you want ot use such charts as part of your %{qooxdoo} application. This means calling into the library's API from your %{qooxdoo} code, which in turn means the library has to be loaded ahead of your code in the browser.

#. As a first step, copy the *.js* file into your app's resource tree, e.g. as

   ::

       source/resource/ponycharts/ponycharts.js

#. Then, make sure your new resource is used by your application code. The main consequence of this is that the *.js* file will be copied over to the build tree of your application, and is being made known to ${qooxdoo}'s ResourceManager. You achieve that by adding an *@asset* hint to the main class of your application or library.

   ::

       /**
        * This is the main class of your custom application "foo".
        *
        * @asset(foo/*)
        * @asset(ponycharts/ponycharts.js)
        */
       qx.Class.define("foo.Application",
           ...
                
   It makes sense to add the *.js* file under its own directory, thereby creating a namespace for it. This allows you to use wildcards should the third-party lib consist of multiple files (e.g. comes with an *.css* file, images, etc.). You could then write

   ::

       /**
        * ...
        * @asset(ponycharts/*)
        */

#. Make sure the PonyCharts *.js* file is loaded before your application code. A simple way to achieve this is to use the :ref:`add-script <pages/tool/generator/generator_config_ref#add-script>` config key. In your `config.json`, under *jobs*, add a *common* job like this.

   ::

       "common" : {
           "add-script" : [
               {
                   "uri" : "resource/ponycharts/ponycharts.js"
               }
           ]
       }

   This will assure the lib is loaded in source and build versions of your app before your code starts. You can now code happily against PonyChart's API.


Wrapping the third-party code in an own %{qooxdoo} library
===========================================================

There is a more elaborate way to use an external %{JS} package, by wrapping it in its own qooxdoo library. Although more work, this has some advantages:

- Easier reuse, e.g. when you want to use the external package in multiple qooxdoo projects.
- Single point of concern, e.g. when the external package needs configuration or certain steps to initialize it.
- Exposing the package's API through a qooxdoo class.
- Automatic dependency management wherever the wrapper class is used.

Step-by-Step Instructions
--------------------------

#. Create a fresh %{qooxdoo} project using `create-application.py`.
#. As in the approach above, copy the external package's files to a suitable place under the `resource` folder, e.g. `source/resource/ponycharts/ponycharts.js`.
#. Likewise, add an `@asset` hint in the library's main class to include the external package as a resource (full example further below).
#. Add code to this class that loads the external package, does necessary initialization and potentially adds a %{qooxdoo}-ish API to it.

   There is a framework class to help you with the loading part, `qx.util.DynamicScriptLoader <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.util.DynamicScriptLoader>`_, which does most of the work to make the package available in the current browser context. Using this, here is how your wrapper class may look like:

   ::

        /**
         * This is the main class of the PonyCharts wrapper.
         *
         * @asset(ponycharts/*)
         */
        qx.Class.define("ponycharts.PonyCharts",
        {
          extend: qx.core.Object,

          construct: function() {
            // initialize the script loading
            var dynLoader = new qx.util.DynamicScriptLoader([
                "ponycharts/ponycharts.js"
            ]);

            dynLoader.addListenerOnce('ready',function(e){
              console.log("all scripts have been loaded!");
              ThePonyChartsTopLevelSymbol.initialize();
            });

            dynLoader.addListener('failed',function(e){
              var data = e.getData();
              console.log("failed to load " + data.script);
            });

            dynLoader.start();
          },

          members: {
            paint: function() {
              ThePonyChartsTopLevelSymbol.paint_demo();
            }
          }
        }

   See `qx.util.DynamicScriptLoader`_ for full details.

#. Add the new %{qooxdoo} library to your main application's configuration. In its *config.json*, add under the *jobs* key

   ::

      "libraries" : {
        "library" : [
          "path" : "<path_to_ponycharts_lib>/Manifest.json"
        ]
      }

#. In the using %{qooxdoo} application, call the correpsonding methods of the wrapper class.

   ::

        qx.Class.define("foo.Application",
        {
          extend: qx.core.Application,

          construct: function() {
            var myPonyCharts = new ponyCharts.PonyCharts();
            myPonyCharts.paint();
          }
        }
 
This should give you a basic outline how you can wrap an external package as a %{qooxdoo} library. You can now use the library for multiple projects, or even publish it as a contribution.
