Application Skeletons
=====================

qooxdoo comes with several different application templates or *skeletons*. Each is meant for a specific usage scenario and includes a different subset of the qooxdoo framework (see the :ref:`architecture diagram<pages/architecture#architecture>` for reference).

When creating a new application using :ref:`create-application.py<pages/getting_started/helloworld#hello_world>`, the *-t* or *--type* parameter specifies the type of skeleton to be used, e.g.

::

  qooxdoo-%{version}-sdk/tool/bin/create-application.py --name=custom --type=mobile

The following skeletons are available:

Gui
---
For a GUI application that looks & feels like a native desktop application (often called “RIA” – Rich Internet Application).

Such a stand-alone application typically creates and updates all content dynamically. Often it is called a “single-page application”, since the document itself is never reloaded or changed.

This is the default choice if the *--type* parameter is not specified.

Inline
------
For a GUI application on a traditional, HTML-dominated web page.

The ideal environment for typical portal sites which use just a few qooxdoo widgets, embedded into the page's existing HTML content.

Mobile
------
For a :ref:`mobile application <pages/mobile/mobile_overview#overview>` running in a WebKit-based browser on iOS or Android (and also on desktop machines). Supports the `mobile widget set <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.ui.mobile>`_.

Native
------
For applications using custom HTML/CSS-based GUIs instead of qooxdoo's widget layer.
