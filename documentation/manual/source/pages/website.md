%{Website}
==========

You use %{Website} to build light-weight, integrated, low-level
components for web sites or other browser-like environments where you
don't want to add graphical elements with qooxdoo. It features a DOM
selector engine (Sizzle), BOM and HTML abstraction layers, and
cross-browser keyboard and pointer (mouse / touch / pen) events. As it
does not contain visual elements, it is independent of image resources
and theming. Its code can be shrink-wrapped into a single %{JS} file,
and is available as an individual download. You can include it like any
other %{JS} library in your projects.

This section provides tutorials and introductory material. For your
daily work with %{Website} the only other thing you need is the [API
reference](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/website-api).
