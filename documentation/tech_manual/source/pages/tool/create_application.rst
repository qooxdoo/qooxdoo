|c_a| - Technical Hints
**********************************************

* **readme.txt**

  Each skeleton has a *readme.txt* file in its top-level folder. I can contain an arbitrary description. But there are also special keys that can appear at the beginning of a line, and are treated specially by the wizard:

  * ``short::`` - contains a short description of the skeleton which is used in the online help of |c_a|, when listing application types with ``--help``.
  * ``default_script::`` - the path (relative to the skeleton's root dir) under which the default script should be stored, the one saying "This application needs to be generated" (usually source/script/custom.js).

* **Files from outside the skeleton structure**
  
  There are files that are not part of the skeleton itself, but copied from central places, as they are shared among the skeletons. These files are

  * ``generate.py`` - copied from ``tool/data/generator/generate.tmpl.py``
  * ``custom.js`` - (path depends on skeleton, usually source/script/custom.js) copied from ``tool/data/generator/needs_generation.js``
