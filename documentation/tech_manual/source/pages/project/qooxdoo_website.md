qooxdoo.org Website
===================

General
-------

The website [qooxdoo.org](http://qooxdoo.org) comprises of three
distinct sub systems with the same look and feel. They share the header
(with the main navigation) and footer (with the sub navigation). Changes
to header or footer must be synced to all sub systems.

> -   **Wiki** (Dokuwiki): The home page and all other content not part
>     of the remaining sub-systems mentioned below.
> -   **Blog** (Wordpress): News and comments.
> -   **Manual** (Sphinx): The qooxdoo manual is heavily linked from the
>     Website. Direct links should generally point to the current
>     version of the qooxdoo manual.

Another sub system is **Bugs** (Bugzilla). It has a similiar theme but
does not share header or footer.

Moreover, the website points to tools, demo apps and downloadable assets
found on [demo.qooxdoo.org](http://demo.qooxdoo.org).

Assets
------

All sub systems retrieve stylesheets and script files from the
[resources](http://resources.qooxdoo.org) host. See
resources.qooxdoo.org for more information.

Screenshots
-----------

For overall consistency, screenshots should be made with anti-aliasing
turned on.

### Thumbnails

Thumbnails of screenshots are used on the
[demos](http://qooxdoo.org/demos) and
[tools](http://qooxdoo.org/demos/tools) page. The thumbnails dimensions
are 285px/177px. Their scale factor is 0.5 compared to the original
screenshot.
