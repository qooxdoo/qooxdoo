About
=====

qooxdoo is a universal JavaScript framework that enables you to create 
applications for a wide range of platforms. With its object-oriented 
programming model you build rich, interactive applications (RIAs), 
native-like apps for mobile devices, light-weight traditional web 
applications or even applications to run outside the browser.

You leverage its integrated tool chain to develop and deploy 
applications of any scale, while taking advantage of modern web 
technologies like HTML5 and CSS3, its comprehensive feature set and a 
state-of-the-art GUI toolkit. qooxdoo is open source under liberal 
licenses, led by the world's largest web host 1&1, with a vibrant 
community.
