    comment: |
      Hey @{{ author }}, thanks for the PR! The review will start once
      the tests and CI checks have passed. If they don't, please review
      the logs and try to fix the issues (ask for help if you can't
      figure it out). A reviewer will be assigned once the tests are
      passing and they'll walk you through getting the PR finished
      and merged.
