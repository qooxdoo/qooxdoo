 * Tangible Theme (Dark)
 *
 * The tangible theme is inspired by ideas from material design. A lot of work went into designing a higly automated color
 * system. In order to customize the theme to your taste, simply create your own color system. Use qx.theme.tangible.ColorDark for inspiration.
 *
 * The Tangible Theme is very new and still in a state of flux. PRs highly welcome. Use https://material.io as a visual guide.
