/**
 * Low-level Document Object Model layer.
 *
 * The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree model that represents the loaded
 * Web document in a browser. The classes of this package model this document
 * object tree, its nodes and their parent-child relations, in a
 * browser-independent way.
