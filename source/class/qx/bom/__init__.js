/**
 * Low-level Browser Object Model layer.
 *
 * This is a low-level layer providing a cross-browser abstraction for object
 * classes typically found in the browser JavaScript runtime. This includes
 * classes like the Document, Element, Event and Image class.
 *
 * The BOM layer of qooxdoo is heavily used internally for higher-level
 * classes, but can also be deployed directly for low-level manipulations.
