Qooxdoo Properties
==========================

qooxdoo comes with its own convenient and sophisticated property management system. In order to understand its power we will first take a look at the ordinary property handling in plain JavaScript first.

Ordinary Property Handling
--------------------------

Let's say we have a property `width` for an object `obj`.

As is a good practice in regular high-level programming languages you should not access object properties directly:

    // NOT RECOMMENDED: direct access to properties
    obj.width = 200;  // setting a value
    var w = obj.width;  // getting the current value

Instead you should work with properties only through so-called *accessor methods* ("getters") and *mutator methods* ("setters"):

    // direct access is no good practice
    obj.setWidth(200);  // setting a value
    var w = obj.getWidth();  // getting the current value

Of course, directly accessing properties may be faster because no indirection by a function call is needed. Nonetheless, in practice this does not outweigh the disadvantages. Direct access to properties does not hide internal implementation details and is a less maintainable solution (Well, you don't program web applications in assembler code, do you?).

A typical implementation of the accessor and mutator methods would look like the following, where those instance methods are declared in the `members` section of the class definition:

    // ordinary example #1
    members:
    {
      getWidth : function() {
        return this._width;
      },

      setWidth : function(width)
      {
        this._width = width;
        return width;
      }
    }

Something that is very familiar to the typical programmer of Java or any other comparable language. Still, it is not very convenient. Even this trivial implementation of only the basic feature requires a lot of keystrokes. More advanced features like type checks, performance optimizations, firing events for value changes, etc. need to be coded by hand. An improved version of the setter could read:

    // ordinary example #2
    members:
    {
      setWidth : function(width)
      {
        if (typeof width != "number") {
          // Type check: Make sure it is a valid number
          throw new Error("Invalid value: Need a valid integer value: " + width);
        };

        if (this._width != width)
        {
          // Optimization: Only set value, if different from the existing value
          this._width = width;

          // User code that should be run for the new value
          this.setStyleProperty("width", width+ "px");
        };

        return width;
      }
    }

Large part of the code found here is for managing the validation and storage of the incoming data. The property-specific user code is rather short.

Qooxdoo Property Handling
-------------------------

Let's see how the above example can be written using qooxdoo's property implementation. The property itself is declared in the `properties` section of the class definition. Only if some property-specific code needs to be run in the setter, an additional `apply` method has to be given:

    // qooxdoo version of ordinary example #2
    properties : {
      width : { check : "Number", apply : "applyWidth" }
    }

    members :
    {
      applyWidth : function(value) {
        this.setStyleProperty("width", value + "px");
      }
    }

Compare that to the lengthy code of the ordinary code example above! Much shorter and nicer, also by objective means. And it almost only contains the "real code".

The apply method may optionally be defined for each property you add to your class. As soon as you define a key "apply" in your property declaration map the method gets automatically called on each property modification (but not during initial initialization). If you do not define an apply method, the property just handles the fundamental storage of your data and its disposal.

Despite needing much less explicit code (keep in mind, for *every* property), it actually contains at least as many features as the hand-tuned code: The type of the property is checked automatically (`Number` in the example above). Moreover, new values are only stored (and the optional apply method called) if different from the existing values. A tiny but important optimization.

### Change Events

qooxdoo supports full-featured event-based programming throughout the framework. So-called *change events* are a good example for this powerful concept.

Each property may optionally behave as an observable. This means it can send out an event at any time the property value changes. Such a change event (an instance of `qx.event.type.Data`) is declared by providing a custom name in the `event` key of the property definition. While you are free to choose any event name you like, the qooxdoo framework tries to consistently use the naming convention `"change + Propertyname"`, e.g. `"changeWidth"` for a change of property `width`. In order to get notified of any value changes, you simply attach an event listener to the object instance containing the property in question.

For example, if you would like the `element` property of a Widget instance `widget` to fire an event named `"changeElement"` any time the value changes.

    properties : {
      element: { event: "changeElement" }
    }

If this happens, you would like to set the DOM element's content:

    widget.addEventListener("changeElement", function(e) {
      e.getData().innerHTML = "Hello World";
    });

The anonymous function acts as an event handler that receives the event object as variable `e`. Calling the predefined method `getData()` returns the new value of property `element`.

Available Methods
-----------------

qooxdoo's dynamic properties not only make sure that all properties behave in a consistent way, but also guarantee that the API to access and manipulate properties are identical. The user is only confronted with a single interface, where the method names are easy to understand. Each property creates (at least) the following set of methods:

-   `setPropertyName()`: Mutator method ("setter") to set a new property value.
-   `getPropertyName()`: Accessor method ("getter") that returns the current value.

Additionally, all properties of boolean type (declared by `check: "Boolean"`) provide the following convenience methods:

-   `isPropertyName()`: Identical to `getPropertyName()`.
-   `togglePropertyName()`: Toggles between true and false.

Property Groups
---------------

Property groups is a layer above the property system explained in the last paragraphs. They make it possible to set multiple values in one step using one `set` call. `qx.ui.core.Widget` supports the property group `padding`. `padding` simply sets the `paddingLeft`, `paddingRight`, `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom` property.

    widget.setPadding(10, 20, 30, 40);

The result is identical to:

    widget.setPaddingTop(10);
    widget.setPaddingRight(20);
    widget.setPaddingBottom(30);
    widget.setPaddingLeft(40);

As you can see the property groups are a nice really convenient feature.

### Shorthand support

One more thing. The property group handling also supports some CSS like magic like the shorthand mode for example. This means that you can define only some edges in one call and the others get filled automatically:

    // four arguments
    widget.setPadding(top, right, bottom, left);

    // three arguments
    widget.setPadding(top, right+left, bottom);

    // two arguments
    widget.setPadding(top+bottom, right+left);

    // one argument
    widget.setPadding(top+right+bottom+left);

As you can see this can also reduce the code base and make it more user-friendly.

BTW: The values of a property group can also be given an array as first argument e.g. these two lines work identically:

    // arguments list
    widget.setPadding(10, 20, 30, 40);

    // first argument as array
    widget.setPadding([10, 20, 30, 40]);

Declaring Properties
-----------

The following code creates a property `myProperty` and the corresponding functions like `setMyProperty()` and `getMyProperty()`.

    qx.Class.define(
    ...
    properties : {
      myProperty : { nullable : true }
    }
    ...

You should define at least one of the attributes `init`, `nullable` or `inheritable`. Otherwise, the first call to the getter would stop with an exception because the computed value is not (yet) defined.

> **note**
>
> As an alternative to the `init` key you could set the init value of the property by calling an initializing function `this.initMyProperty(value)` in the constructor. See below for details.

Handling changes of property values
-----------------------------------

You have multiple possibilities to react on each property change. With *change* the modification of a property is meant, where the old and the new values differ from each other.

As a class developer the easiest solution with the best performance is to define an apply method. As a user of a class (the one who creates instances) it is the best to simply attach an event listener to the instance, if such an corresponding event is provided in the property declaration.

### Defining an apply method

To attach an apply method you must add a key `apply` to your configuration which points to a name of a function which needs to be available in your `members` section. As the apply method normally should not be called directly, it is always a good idea to make the method at least protected by prefixing the name with an underscore `_`.

The return value of the apply method is ignored. The first argument is the actual value, the second one is the former or old value. The last argument is the name of the property which can come very handy if you use one apply method for more than one property. The second and third arguments are optional and may be left out.

#### Example

    properties : {
      width : { apply : "_applyWidth" }
    },

    members :
    {
      _applyWidth : function(value, old, name) {
        // do something...
      }
    }

The applying method is only called when the value has changed.

> **note**
>
> When using reference data types like `Object` or `Array` the apply method is **always** called, since these are different objects and indeed different values. This is JavaScript functionality and not qooxdoo specific.

For a more technical description, take a look at the [API documentation of qx.core.Property](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.core.Property)

### Providing an event interface

For the users of a class it is in many cases a nice idea to also support an event to react on property changes. The event is defined using the `event` key where the value is the name of the event which should be fired.

qooxdoo fires a `qx.event.type.Data` which supports the methods `getData()` and `getOldData()` to allow easy access to the new and old property value, respectively.

> **note**
>
> Events are only useful for public properties. Events for protected and private properties are usually not a good idea.

#### Example

    properties : {
      label : { event : "changeLabel" }
    }
    ...
    // later in your application code:
    obj.addListener("changeLabel", function(e) {
      alert(e.getData());
    });

Init values
-----------

Init values are supported by all properties. These values are stored separately by the property engine. This way it is possible to fallback to the init value when property values are being reset.

### Defining an init value

There are two ways to set an init value of a property.

#### Init value in declaration

The *preferred* way for regular init values is to simply declare them by an `init` key in the property configuration map. You can use this key standalone or in combination with `nullable` and/or `inheritable`.

    properties : {
      myProperty : { init : "hello" }
    }

#### Init value in constructor

Alternatively, you could set the init value of the property in the constructor of the class. This is only recommended for cases where a declaration of an init value as explained above is not sufficient.

Using an initializing function `this.initMyProperty(value)` in the constructor would allow you to assign complex non-primitive types (so-called "reference types" like `Array`, `Object`) that should not be shared among instances, but be unique on instance level.

Another scenario would be to use a localizable init value when internationalizing your application \<development/internationalization\>: Because `this.tr()` cannot be used in the property definition, you may either use the static `qx.locale.Manager.tr()` there instead, or use `this.tr()` in the call of the initializing function in the constructor.

> **note**
>
> You need to add a `deferredInit:true` to the property configuration to allow for a deferred initialization for reference types as mentioned above.

    qx.Class.define("qx.MyClass", {
      construct: function() {
        this.initMyProperty([1, 2, 4, 8]);
      },
      properties : {
        myProperty : { deferredInit : true}
      }
    };

### Applying an init value

It is possible to apply the init value using an user-defined apply method. To do this call the init method `this.initMyProperty(value)` somewhere in your constructor - this "change" will than trigger calling the apply method. Of course, this only makes sense in cases where you have at least an `apply` or `event` entry in the property definition.

If you do not use the init method you must be sure that the instances created from the classes are in a consistent state. The getter will return the init value even if not initialized. This may be acceptable in some cases, e.g. for properties without `apply` or `event`. But there are other cases, where the developer needs to be carefully and call the init method because otherwise the getter returns wrong information about the internal state (due to an inconsistency between init and applied value).

Like calling the `this.initMyProperty(value)` method itself, you could call the setter and use the defined init value as parameter. This will call the apply method, not like in the usual cases when setting the same value which is already set.

    construct : function()
    {
      this.base(arguments);

      this.setColor("black"); // apply will be invoked
      this.setColor("black"); // apply will NOT be invoked
    },

    properties :
    {
      color :
      {
        init : "black",
        apply : "_applyColor"
      }
    },

    members :
    {
      _applyColor : function(value, old) {
        // do something...
      }
    }

This example illustrates how the behavior differs from the default behavior of the property system due to the already mentioned inconsistency between init and applied value.

    construct : function()
    {
      this.base(arguments);

      // Initialize color with predefined value
      this.initColor();

      // Initialize store with empty array
      this.initStore([]);
    },

    properties :
    {
      color :
      {
        init : "black",
        apply : "_applyColor"
      },

      store : {
        apply : "_applyStore"
      }
    },

    members :
    {
      _applyColor : function(value, old) {
        // do something...
      },

      _applyStore : function(value, old) {
        // do something...
      }
    }

In the above example you can see the different usage possibilities regarding properties and their init values. If you do not want to share "reference types" (like `Array`, `Object`) between instances, the init values of these have to be declared in the constructor and not in the property definition.

If an `init` value is given in the property declaration, the init method does not accept any parameters. The init methods always use the predefined init values. In cases where there is no `init` value given in the property declaration, it is possible to call the init method with one parameter, which represents the init value. This may be useful to apply reference types to each instance. Thus they would not be shared between instances.

> **note**
>
> Please remember that init values are not for incoming user values. Please use `init` only for class defined things, not for user values. Otherwise you torpedo the multi-value idea behind the dynamic properties.

### Refining init values

Derived classes can refine the init value of a property defined by their super class. This is however the only modification which is allowed through inheritance. To refine a property just define two keys inside the property (re-)definition: `init` and `refine`. `refine` is a simple boolean flag which must be configured to true.

Normally properties could not be overridden. This is the reason for the `refine` flag . The flag informs the implementation that the developer is aware of the feature and the modification which should be applied.

    properties : {
      width : { refine : true, init : 100 }
    }

This will change the default value at definition time. `refine` is a better solution than a simple `set` call inside the constructor because it the initial value is stored in a separate namespace as the user value and so it is possible for the user to fall back to the default value suggested by the developer of a class.

Checking incoming values
------------------------

You can check incoming values by adding a `check` key to the corresponding property definition. But keep in mind that these checks only apply in the development (source) version of the application. Due to performance optimization, we strip these checks for the build version. If you want a property validation, take a look at the validation section \<pages/defining\_properties\#validation\_incoming\_values\>.

### Predefined types

You can check against one of these predefined types:

-   `Boolean`, `String`, `Number`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Double`
-   `Object`, `Array`, `Map`
-   `Class`, `Mixin`, `Interface`, `Theme`
-   `Error`, `RegExp`, `Function`, `Date`, `Node`, `Element`, `Document`, `Window`, `Event`

Due to the fact that JavaScript only supports the `Number` data type, `Float` and `Double` are handled identically to `Number`. Both are still useful, though, as they are supported by the Javadoc-like comments and the API viewer.

    properties : {
      width : { init : 0, check: "Integer" }
    }

### Possible values

One can define an explicit list of possible values:

    properties : {
      color: { init : "black", check : [ "red", "blue", "orange" ] }
    }

> **note**
>
> Providing a list of possible values only works with primitive types (like strings and numbers), but not with reference types (like objects, functions, etc.).

### Instance checks

It is also possible to only allow for instances of a class. This is not an explicit class name check, but rather an `instanceof` check. This means also instances of *any* class derived from the given class will be accepted. The class is defined using a string, thereby to not influencing the load time dependencies of a class.

    properties : {
      logger : { nullable : true, check : "qx.log.Logger" }
    }

### Interface checks

The incoming value can be checked against an interface, i.e. the value (typically an instance of a class) must implement the given interface. The interface is defined using a string, thereby not influencing the load time dependencies of a class.

    properties : {
      application : { check : "qx.application.IApplication" }
    }

### Implementing custom checks

Custom checks are possible as well, using a custom function defined inside the property definition. This is useful for all complex checks which could not be solved with the built-in possibilities documented above.

    properties :
    {
      progress :
      {
        init : 0,
        check : function(value) {
          return !isNaN(value) && value >= 0 && value <= 100;
        }
      }
    }

This example demonstrates how to handle numeric values which only accept a given range of numbers (here 0 .. 100). The possibilities for custom checks are only limited by the developer's imagination. ;-)

#### Alternative solution

As an alternative to the custom check *function*, you may also define a *string* which will directly be incorporated into the setters and used in a very efficient way. The above example could be coded like this:

    properties :
    {
      progress :
      {
        init : 0,
        check : "!isNaN(value) && value >= 0 && value <= 100"
      }
    }

This is more efficient, particularly for checks involving rather small tests, as it omits the function call that would be needed in the variant above. But make sure the identifier you are using is named **value**, otherwise you will not be checking the incoming property value.

Transforming incoming values
----------------------------

You can transform incoming values before they are stored by using the transform key to the corresponding property definition. The transform method occurs before the check and apply functions and can also throw an error if the value passed to it is invalid. This method is useful if you wish accept different formats or value types for a property.

### Example

Here we define both a check and transform method for the width property. Though the check method requires that the property be a integer, we can use the transform method to accept a string and transform it into an integer. Note that we can still rely on the check method to catch any other incorrect values, such as if the user mistakenly assigned a Widget to the property.

    properties :
    {
       width :
       {
          init : 0,
          transform: "_transformWidth",
          check: "Integer"
       }
    },

    members :
    {
       _transformWidth : function(value, oldValue)
       {
          if ( qx.lang.Type.isString(value) )
          {
              value = parseInt(value, 10);
          }

          return value;
       }
    }

The transform function is passed a second parameter which is the value previously set - note that the first time that transform is called, the oldValue parameter will be undefined

Asynchronous Properties using Promises
--------------------------------------

Sometimes it may be necessary for an applyXxx method to take some time to complete, in which case it is necessary to consider coding asynchronously to allow for a better user experience. Perhaps more importantly, if your apply method includes triggering a server roundtrip then changes to the specification (<https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/>) have deprecated synchronous XMLHttpRequest, and some browsers (eg Safari) already have very short timeouts for synchronous XMLHttpRequests which cannot be overridden.

Properties can be made asynchronous by using qx.Promise.

The return value for apply methods is normally ignored, but if it returns an instance of qx.Promise the setXxx method will wait for the promise to be fulfilled before firing the changeXxx event.

As setXxx method returns the value which has been set, it is not possible to return the promise to the caller - to retrieve the promise, you must tell Qooxdoo that the property is asynchronous by setting the async: true in the property definition and then calling the setXxxAsync method:

    properties :
    {
       name :
       {
          init : 0,
          check: "String",
          apply : "_applyName",
          event: "changeName",
          async: true
       }
    },

    members :
    {
       _applyName : function(name)
       {
           return new qx.Promise(function(fulfilled) {
               // ... do something asynchronous here
               fulfilled(); // Finally done the asynchrons task
           });
       }
    }

    // ... snip ...
    myObject.setNameAsync("abc").then(function() {
        // only now has the name been changed and the "changeName" event been fired
    });

Note that the setXxxAsync method is *only* available if you have specified async: true in the property definition

As well as setXxxAsync there is also a matching getXxxAsync method and a changeXxxAsync event which can be fired; event handlers can return promises, and asynchronous properties can be bound using qx.core.Object.bind()

Validation of incoming values
-----------------------------

Validation of a property can prevent the property from being set if it is not valid. In that case, a validation error should be thrown by the validator function. Otherwise, the validator can just do nothing.

### Using a predefined validator

If you use predefined validators, they will throw a validation error for you. You can find a set of predefined validators in qx.util.Validate. The following example shows the usage of a range validator.

    properties : {
      application : { validate : qx.util.Validate.range(0, 100) }
    }

### Using a custom validator

If the predefined validators are not enough for you validation, you can specify your own validator.

    properties : {
      application : { validate : function(value) {
          if (value > 10) {
            throw new qx.core.ValidationError(
              "Validation Error: ", value + " is greater than 10."
            );
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Validation method as member

You can define a validation method as a member of the class containing the property. If you have such a member validator, you can just specify the method name as a sting

    properties : {
      application : { validate : "_validateApplication" }
    }

Enabling theme support
----------------------

The property system supports *multiple values per property* as explained in the paragraph about the init values. The theme value is another possible value that can be stored in a property. It has a lower priority than the user value and a higher priority than the init value. The `setThemed` and `resetThemed` methods are part of qooxdoo's theme layer and should not be invoked by the user directly.

    setter                                    value                   resetter

    setProperty(value)            ^           user           |        resetProperty()
                                  |                          |
    setThemedProperty(value)   Priority       theme      Fallback     resetThemedProperty()
                                  |                          |
    initProperty([value])         |           init           v        n.a.

To enable theme support it is sufficient to add a `themeable` key to the property definition and set its value to `true`.

    properties : {
      width : { themeable : true, init : 100, check : "Number" }
    }

> **note**
>
> `themeable` should only be enabled for truly *theme-relevant* properties like color and decorator, but not for *functional* properties like enabled, tabIndex, etc.

Working with inheritance
------------------------

Another great feature of the new property system is inheritance. This is primarily meant for widgets, but should be usable in independent parent-children architectures, too.

Inheritance quickly becomes nothing short of vital for the property system, if you consider that it can reduce redundancy dramatically. It is advantageous both in terms of coding size and storage space, because a value only needs to be declared once for multiple objects inside an hierarchy. Beyond declaring such an inheritable property once, only intended exceptions to the inherited values need to be given to locally override those values.

The inheritance as supported by qooxdoo's properties is comparable to the inheritance known from CSS. This means, for example, that all otherwise undefined values of inheritable properties automatically fall back to the corresponding parent's value.

Each property may also have an explicit user value of string `"inherit"`. The inherited value, which is normally only used as a fallback value, can thus be emphasized by setting `"inherit"` explicitly. The user may set a property to `"inherit"` in order to enforce lookup by inheritance, and thereby ignoring init and appearance values.

To mark a property as inheritable simply add the key `inheritable` and set it to `true`:

    properties : {
      color : { inheritable : true, nullable : true }
    }

Optionally, you can configure an init value of `inherit`. This is especially a good idea if the property should not be nullable:

    properties : {
      color : { inheritable : true, init: "inherit" }
    }

### Inheritable CSS properties

To give you an idea for what kind of custom properties inheritance is particularly useful, the following list of prominent CSS properties which support inheritance may be a good orientation:

-   `color`

Internal methods
----------------

The property documentation in the user manual explains the public, non-internal methods for each property. However, there are some more, which are not meant for public use:

-   `this.resetProperty(value)` : For properties which are inheritable. Used by the inheritance system to transfer values from parent to child widgets.
-   `this.setThemedProperty(value)` : For properties with `appearance` enabled. Used to store a separate value for the appearance of this property. Used by the appearance layer.
-   `this.resetThemedProperty(value)` : For properties with `appearance` enabled. Used to reset the separately stored appearance value of this property. Used by the appearance layer.

Defining property groups
------------------------

Property groups is a convenient feature as it automatically generates setters and resetters (but no getters) for a group of properties. A definition of such a group reads:

    properties : {
      location : { group : [ "left", "top" ] }
    }

As you can see, property groups are defined in the same map as "regular" properties. From a user perspective the API with setters and resetters is equivalent to the API of regular properties:

    obj.setLocation( 50, 100);

    // instead of
    // obj.setLeft(50);
    // obj.setTop(100);

### Shorthand support

Additionally, you may also provide a mode which modifies the incoming data before calling the setter of each group members. Currently, the only available modifier is `shorthand`, which emulates the well-known CSS shorthand support for qooxdoo properties. For more information regarding this feature, please have a look at the user manual \<understanding\_properties\>. The definition of such a property group reads:

    properties :
    {
      padding :
      {
        group : [ "paddingTop", "paddingRight", "paddingBottom", "paddingLeft" ],
        mode : "shorthand"
      }
    }

For example, this would allow to set the property in the following way:

    obj.setPadding( 10, 20 );

    // instead of
    // obj.setPaddingTop(10);
    // obj.setPaddingRight(20);
    // obj.setPaddingBottom(10);
    // obj.setPaddingLeft(20);
    }

When to use properties?
-----------------------

Since properties in qooxdoo support advanced features like validation, events and so on, they might not be quite as lean and fast as an ordinarily coded property that only supports a setter and getter. If you do not need these advanced features or the variable you want to store is *extremely* time critical, it might be better not to use qooxdoo's dynamic properties in those cases. You might instead want to create your own setters and getters (if needed) and store the value just as a hidden private variable (e.g. `__varName`) inside your object.
