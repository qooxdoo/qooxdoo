# Data Binding

Data binding is a [concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binding) by which
two data items are bound, so that changes to one are propagated to the second,
and vice versa. This requires the possibility to detect such changes during
runtime. In Qooxdoo,
[class properties](/core/understanding_properties#understanding_properties)
fulfill this requirement.

Using data binding allows you to e.g. keep two widgets automatically
synchronized over the runtime of your application, although they might be
spatially separated and have wildly different visual representations (e.g. a
text field and a spinner).
