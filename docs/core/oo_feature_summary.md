# Features of Object Orientation

## Class definition

A class is defined by providing its name as a string:

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class");

This example only creates a trivial class `my.cool.Class`. A typical
class declaration contains OO features like constructor, instance
members, static members, etc. This additional information is provided as
a second argument in the form of a map. Since the entire class definition
is given in `qx.Class.define()`, it is called a "closed form" of class
declaration: :

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class", {
      // declare constructor, members, ...
    });

A regular (non-static) class can simply be instantiated using the `new`
keyword: :

    var myClass = new my.cool.Class();

## Inheritance

In order to derive the current class from another class, the reference
to the super class is provided by the key `extend`: :

    qx.Class.define("my.great.SuperClass", {
      // I'm the super class
    });
    
    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class", {
      extend : my.great.SuperClass
    });

## Constructor

The constructor of a regular class is provided as a function declaration
in key `construct`:

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      extend : my.great.SuperClass,
      construct : function() {
        ...
      }
    });

## Static members

Static members (often called "class" members) are also part of the class
definition and declared in a map with the `statics` key. Static *methods*
are given by providing a function declaration, while all other values
declare static *attributes*. Typically they are given in uppercase to
distinguish them from instance members:

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      statics :
      {
        FOO : VALUE,
        BAR : function() { ... }
      }
    });

Static members, both methods and attributes, can be accessed by using
the fully-qualified class name:

    my.cool.Class.FOO = 3.141;
    my.cool.Class.BAR();

> :warning: Note that you can use static members as constants, but there is nothing
to prevent their value from being changed at run time!

## Accessing Static Members

Generic form. Requires no updates if class name changes. This code can
optionally be optimized for performance in build versions.

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      statics : {
        PI : 3.141
      },
      members : {
        circumference : function(radius) {
          return 2 * this.constructor.PI * radius;
        }
      }
    });

> :warning: For `this.constructor` to be available, the class must have as a direct or
indirect base class `qx.core.Object`.

Static members aren't inherited. To call a superclass static method,
use `this.superclass`, as in this example:

    qx.Class.define('A', {
      statics: {
         f: function() {}
      }
    });
    
    qx.Class.define('B'), {
      extend: A,
      members: {
         e: function() {
            this.superclass.self(arguments).f();
         }
      }
    });

Static functions can access other static functions directly through the
`this` keyword.

## Instance Members

Similar to static members, instance members are also part of the class
definition, in the map referenced by the `members` key:

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      members:
      {
        foo : VALUE,
        bar : function() { ... }
      }
    });

The instance members can be accessed by using an actual instance of a
class:

    var myClass1 = new my.cool.Class();
    myClass1.foo = 3.141;
    myClass1.bar();


## Calling the Superclass Constructor

Generic form. Requires no updates if super class (name) changes. This
code can optionally be optimized for performance in build versions. :

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      extend : my.great.SuperClass,
      construct : function(x) {
        this.base(arguments, x);
      }
    });

## Calling the Overridden Superclass Method

Generic form without using `prototype`. Requires no updates if super
class (name) changes. This code can optionally be optimized for
performance in build versions. :

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      extend : my.great.SuperClass,
      ...
      members : {
        foo : function(x) {
          this.base(arguments, x);
        }
      }
    });

## Destructor

As a logical match to any existing constructor given by the key
`construct`, a destructor is explicitly given by the `destruct` key: :

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      extend : my.great.SuperClass,
      construct : function() {
        ...
      }
      destruct : function() {
        ...
      }
    });

## Properties

qooxdoo comes with a very powerful feature called dynamic 
[properties](understanding_properties.md). A concise declaration of an `age` property
may look like the following:

    qx.Class.define(
    ...
    properties : {
      age: { init: 10, check: "Integer" }
    }
    ...

This declaration generates not only a corresponding accessor method
`getAge()` and a mutator method `setAge()`, but would allow for many
more [features](property_features.md).

## Interfaces

A leading uppercase `I` is used as a naming convention for `interfaces
<interfaces>`.

    qx.Interface.define("my.cool.IInterface");

## Mixins

Leading uppercase `M` as a naming convention. A [mixin](mixins.md) can
have all the things a class can have, like properties, constructor,
destructor and members. :

    qx.Mixin.define("my.cool.MMixin",
    {
      // Mixin definition
    });

## Attaching mixins to a class

The `include` key contains either a reference to a single mixin, or an
array of mixins: :

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      include : [my.cool.MMixin, my.other.cool.MMixin]
      ...
    });

## Attaching mixins to an already defined class

    qx.Class.include(qx.ui.core.Widget, qx.MWidgetExtensions);

## Access

The following naming convention is used. The goal is to be as consistent as
possible. During the build process private members can optionally be
renamed to random names (obfuscated) to prevent inadvertently calling them
from outside of the class. :

    publicMember
    _protectedMember
    __privateMember

## Static classes

Explicit declaration allows for useful checks during development. For
example. `construct` or `members` keys are not allowed in a purely
static class. :

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class", {
      type : "static"
    });

## Abstract classes

Declaring a class as "abstract" allows for useful checks during development
and does not require explicit code. :

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class", {
      type : "abstract"
    });

## Singletons

A "singleton" declaration allows does not require explicit code. A
`getInstance()` method is added automatically to each singleton class. :

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      type : "singleton",
      extend :  my.great.SuperClass
    });

## Immediate access to previously defined members

The closed form of the class definition does not allow immediate access
to other members, as they are part of the configuration data structure
themselves. While it is typically not a feature used very often, it
nonetheless needs to be supported by the new class declaration. Instead
of some trailing code outside the closed form of the class declaration,
an optional `defer` method is called after the other parts of the class
definition have been processed. It allows access to all previously
declared `statics`, `members` and dynamic `properties`.

> :warning: If the feature of accessing previously defined members is not absolutely
necessary, `defer` **should not be used** in the class definition. It is
missing some important capabilities compared to the regular members
definition and it cannot take advantage of many crucial features of the
build process (documentation, optimization, etc.).

    qx.Class.define("my.cool.Class",
    {
      statics:
      {
        driveLetter : "C"
      },
      defer: function(statics, members, properties)
      {
        statics.drive = statics.driveLetter + ":\\";
        members.whatsTheDrive = function() {
          return "Drive is " + statics.drive;
        };
      }
    });

## Browser specific methods

To maintain the closed form, browser switches at the method level is done
using [environment settings](../core/environment.md). Since the
generator knows about environment settings it is (optionally) possible
to only keep the code for each specific browser and remove the
implementation for all other browsers from the code and thus generate
highly-optimized browser-specific builds. It is possible to use a
logical _or_ directly inside a environment key. If none of the keys
matches the variant, the "default" key is used: :

    members:
    {
      foo: qx.core.Environment.select("engine.name",
      {
        "mshtml|opera": function() {
           // Internet Explorer or Opera
        },
        "default": function() {
           // All other browsers
        }
      })
    }

## Events

qooxdoo's class definition has a special `events` key. The value of the
key is a map, which maps each distinct event name to the name of the
event class whose instances are passed to the event listeners. The event
system can (optionally) check whether an event type is supported by
the class and issue a warning if an event type is unknown. This ensures
that each supported event must be listed in the event map. :

    qx.Class.define("my.eventful.Class",
    {
      extend: qx.core.Target,
    
      events : {
        "custom": "qx.event.type.Data"
      }
      ...
    })
