## qx.bom - Browser Object Model

The classes contained in the `qx.bom` namespace provide a cross-browser
abstraction layer for object classes of the browser %{JS} runtime.

The BOM classes mainly consists of the following three parts:

  - DOM element manipulation
  - wrappers for native layers/objects
  - powerful low-level helper classes

See the API reference of [qx.bom](apps://apiviewer/#qx.bom) for
more details.

### DOM element manipulation

The `qx.bom.element` package allows you to manipulate DOM elements in
almost any way you can think of. Each class is offering several `static`
methods that take a DOM element as their first argument. Since those BOM
classes are static, no instances need to be created in order to
manipulate a DOM element in the document.

The following manipulations are offered by the `qx.bom.element` package:

<div class="index">

dimension, location, scroll, overflow, style, CSS, decoration, opacity,
animation, attribute, property, background, cursor

</div>

  - Dimension and location
  - Box-sizing - supports the modes `content-box` (W3C model) and
    `border-box` (Microsoft model)
  - Scroll and overflow
  - Style querying and modification
  - CSS class name support - supports multiple class names for each
    element
  - Scroll elements into view
  - powerful low-level decoration support
  - cross-browser support for opacity - optimized for animations
  - CSS3 transforms and animations
  - Attribute/Property handling
  - Background images and support for the clip property
  - Cursor property

### Wrapper for native layers/objects

These classes offer an unique and powerful way to deal with native
layers and objects. Wrappers exist for:

  - the current document
  - DOM elements to be connected to qooxdoo's event system
  - native event management
  - flash embedding
  - CSS font styles
  - several native controls like `iframe`, `form elements`, `label` and
    `image` elements

As every object or layer is abstracted by a corresponding qooxdoo class
you can use these BOM classes to interact without worrying about the
underlying browser used.

### Additional classes

These additional classes help in developing low-level, cross-browser
applications.

Features include:

  - unified XMLHttp transport implementation
  - powerful client detection classes
  - low-level `Range` and `Selection` API
  - helper class for browser history
  - wrapper for working with CSS stylesheets
  - string utility class
  - helper class for the client's viewport
  - helper class for VML

## qx.dom - Cross-browser DOM manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree model that represents the
document in a browser. The classes provided by this packages allow you
to query, to manipulate (i.e. add, remove, change order or replace) and
to check the nodes contained in the DOM.

Currently the `qx.dom` package consists of three classes:

  - **Element**: manages children structures, inserts, removes and
    replaces nodes
  - **Hierarchy**: for querying nodes
  - **Node**: basic node creation and type detection

See the API reference of [qx.dom](apps://apiviewer/#qx.dom) for
more details.

## qx.xml - XML handling

This package is all about working with XML documents in a cross-browser
way. Its three classes are:

  - **Document**: creating an XML document
  - **Element**: API to select, query and serialize XML elements
  - **String**: escaping and unescaping of XML strings

See the API reference of [qx.xml](apps://apiviewer/#qx.xml) for
more details.
