# Core

Qooxdoo Core is not a component on its own, but encompasses central features of
the Qooxdoo class library. The elements described here are available in all
Qooxdoo components, be it Desktop, Mobile, or Server. Among these features are a
dedicated class system with custom class properties, data binding and a runtime
environment.

We recommend that you at least make your way through the following chapters:

- [Introduction to Object Orientation](oo_introduction.md)
- [Features of Object Orientation](oo_feature_summary.md) 
- [Classes](oo_introduction.md#classes) from the

They provide the foundation for working with Qooxdoo's class system. 

Also, have a look at the sections on 

- [Qooxdoo Data Arrays](array.md) and [Data Binding](data_binding/README.md) and
- [Promises and Async Programming](promises.md)

for introduction into somewhat more advanced Qooxdoo features.

The other chapters can be read when the need arises, and as
reference material for the other components' documentation.
