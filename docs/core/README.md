Core
====

qooxdoo Core is not a component on its own, but encompasses central features of
the qooxdoo class library. The elements described here are available in all
qooxdoo components, be it Desktop, Mobile, Website or Server. Among these
features are a dedicated class system with custom class properties, data binding
and a runtime environment.

We recommend that you at least make your way through the chapters 
[Introduction to Object Orientation](oo_introduction.md), 
[Features of Object Orientation](oo_feature_summary.md) and 
[Classes](oo_introduction.md#classes) from the [Object Orientation](oo_introduction.md#classes) 
section, which provide the foundation for working with
qooxdoo's class system. The other chapters can be read when the need arises, and
as reference material for the other components' documentation.
