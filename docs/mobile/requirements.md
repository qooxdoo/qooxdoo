# Mobile Requirements

devices. Working with Mobile requires access to such a mobile
device, with a suitable mobile browser, or a mobile emulator
for the respective platform that runs on your desktop PC.

## SDK

Working with Mobile requires downloading and using Qooxdoo's SDK.
See here for the [SDK's installation](../README.md), and follow
its *Installation and Setup* section. This requirement applies to
the development phase only, the final app is independent of the SDK.

or Internet Explorer) on your system to run and test the application.
An iOS, Android or Windows Phone 8 device is not necessarily required.
