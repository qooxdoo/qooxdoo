# Overview

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is the application layer that is, as
the name says, visible to the user of the application, and the layer that
the user normally interacts with. Qooxdoo's API provides a well crafted
architecture to build responsive, themeable and future-proof graphical
user interfaces that closely resemble classical desktop applications,
while keeping all the advantages of a web-based application, using
well-understood concepts such as widgets, layouts, events, themes etc.
