## IDEs and Code editors

Currently, the following IDEs and editors that specifically support Qooxdoo
development natively or with a plug-in:

- [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com//products.html) (PHPStorm, Webstorm
  IntelliJ IDEA): Code analysis and navigation (including auto-generated
  methods), auto-complete.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) VSCode has lots of plugins and is a great
  fit for Qooxdoo development (as well as other platforms).  You can configure VSCode
  with lots of nice features, including automatic reformat on save with Prettier.IO
