# Unit Testing

qooxdoo comes with its own, nicely integrated [Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
environment, similar to JSUnit and based on the [Sinon library (v1.9.1)](https://sinonjs.org/releases/v1.17.7).
See Qooxdoo's [unit testing API](https://api.qooxdoo.org/#qx.dev.unit).

Unit Testing is best suited for isolated pieces of functionality without side effects, such as
libraries. If you want to test the business logic of your application which involves change of
application state, we recommend to use Qooxdoo's [GUI Testing](gui_testing.md) infrastructure, 
which uses an external testrunner.

## Writing a test class

```javascript
qx.Class.define("MyApp.test.DemoTest",
{
  extend : qx.dev.unit.TestCase,

  members :
  {
    /*
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      TESTS
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    */
  
    /**
     * Here are some simple tests
     */
    testSimple : function()
    {
      this.assertEquals(4, 3+1, "This should never fail!");
      this.assertFalse(false, "Can false be true?!");
    },

    /**
     * Here are some more advanced tests
     */
    testAdvanced: function () 
    {
      var a = 3;
      var b = a;
      this.assertIdentical(a, b, "A rose by any other name is still a rose");
      this.assertInRange(3, 1, 10, "You must be kidding, 3 can never be outside [1,10]!");
    }
  }
});
```

If you use `qx create` to create your app an example test class is generated for you!

## Preparing your application for browser tests
To run browser based test you have to

  - install testapper with `qx package install qooxdoo/qxl.testtapper --save=0`
  - prepare testapper application in your `compile.json` by adding your test namespace:
  
```json
      "environment": {
        "testtapper.testNameSpace": "myapp.test"
      },
```

   - include your test classes

```json
      "include": [
        "myapp.test.*"
      ],
```

   - write some tests:
   
```javascript
qx.Class.define("myapp.test.MyTest",
{
  extend : qx.dev.unit.TestCase,
  members :
  {
    testOne : function() {
      this.assertTrue(1 === 1);
  }
});
```

## Mocking a server backend
   
If you want to test behavior of your application that depends on making HTTP requests 
to a backend, you can use the built-in [Fake Server](fake_server.md) to mock server responses. 
 
## Running the tests

The unit tests can be run using the [TestTapper application](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qxl.testtapper/blob/master/README.md),
which you can easily install by executing `npx qx package install --save=0 qooxdoo/qxl.testtapper`.
(`--save=0` ensures that this test runner is not registered as a permanent dependency of your
application). 

 -  If you want to see the results of your tests in the browsers, execute `npx qx serve -S`. 
 This will run the built-in server. Open the link that is printed to the console, which opens
 the Qooxdoo application server startpage. There, click on "TestTapper" to start the visual testrunner.
 
 - To see the test results as output of a command line script (in the syntax of the 
 [TAP protocol](https://node-tap.org/tap-protocol/)), execute `npx qx test`. 
 This will run the server similarly to `npx qx serve`, and run the tests in a headless browser. 
 To run a single test, you can use `qx test --class myapp.test.MyTest --method testOne`
