# Writing API Documentation

For documenting the qooxdoo API special comments in the source
code (so-called "doc comments") are used. The doc comments in
qooxdoo are similar to [JSDoc comments](https://jsdoc.app/) or
[Javadoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/javadoc.html)
comments. To account for some qooxdoo specific needs there are certain differences
to the two systems mentioned above.

For a complete treatment of the syntax see the [JSDoc reference](api_jsdoc_ref.md)
and see the special [information on the ``@ignore` tag](api_jsdoc_at_ignore.md).

## An introductory example

Doc comments are specially formatted comment blocks enclosed by `/**`
and `*/`. A typical use case is to put them in front of a method
definition. You start with a general description of the method, and then
add sections that start with `@` followed by a special key that describes
e.g. a parameter or the return type of the method. Here is an example:

```javascript
    /**
     * Shows a message to the user.
     *
     * @param {string} text The message to show.
     */
    showMessage(text) {
      //...
    }
```

The `@param` attribute entry describes the parameter `text`. Description
texts may also include markup for highlighting and structure.

Here is a longer example that covers an entire class file:
```javascript
/**
 * General class description.
 */
qx.Class.define("mypackage.MyClass",
{
  extend : blubb.MySuperClass,

  /**
   * Constructor description.
   *
   * @param param1 {Integer} description of first parameter\
   */
  construct(param1) {
    //...
  },

   properties :
   {
      /** Property definitions. */
      "myProperty" :
       {
          check : "Number",
          init : 0
       }
    },

    members :
    {
      /** 
       * @param {Number} a
       * @param {Number} b
       * @return {Number}
       */
      add(a, b) {
        return a+b;
      }
    },

    statics :
    {
      /** 
       * @param {Object} foo
       * @param {Number} bar
       */
      setBaz(foo, bar)
      {
        foo.baz = bar;
      },

      /**
       * @var {Number}
       */
      MY_CONSTANT : 100
    }
});
```
 

The class description is taken as the first comment in the file
which starts with `/**`. Therefore if you have a comment at the
start of the file which has a first line of `/**********`, that will
be taken as the class description, overriding any comment above the
class itself. Therefore use `/* *********` or `/* ==========` etc.

## Advanced Doc Comments

Here is a more advanced example of a method documentation block that
uses more `@` keys to provide structured information about the method.

```javascript
    /**
    * Handles a drop.
    *
    * @param {qx.bla.DragSource} dragSource The drag source that was dropped.
    * @param {Element} targetElement The target element the drop aims to.
    * @param {Integer|null} dropType  the drop type. This is the same type
    *        as used in {@link qx.bla.DragEvent}.
    * @return {Boolean} whether the event was handled.
    * @throws {Error} if the targetElement is no child of this drop target.
    *
    * @see #getDragEvent
    * @see qx.bla.DragEvent
    */
    handleDrop(dragSource, targetElement, dropType) {
      //...
    }
```


This will render in the API Viewer similarly to this:

As mentioned above the [JSDoc reference](api_jsdoc_ref.md) has
the complete list of possible section keys and markup possibilities.


## Generate the API Viewer

If you haven't already, install the apiviewer package without making it
a dependency of your application: 
```shell script
npx qx pkg install --save=0 qooxdoo/qxl.apiviewer
```

Then start the Qooxdoo application server...

```shell script
npx qx serve -S
```

... and click on the API Viewer application to see your applications API in its
full beauty alongside the Qooxdoo API

## Advanced usage

### `__init__.js`

While documenting a class files where JSDoc comments are interleaved
with the class code seems straight forward, this is not so obvious
if you want to provide documentation for a collection of classes
under a common namespace (like *qx.ui.core*, *qx.util*, etc.).

In order to fill this gap you can add a `__init__.js` file to the topmost
directory of that particular collection. This file should contain only a
single JSDoc comment that describes the collection as a whole. These files
are then scanned by the apiviewer application and the documentation is
inserted at the nodes, together with a list of classes of the
corresponding collection, in the documentation tree. See the API documentation
for the [qx.core namespace](apps://apiviewer/#qx.core) as examples.
