# Qooxdoo Tutorials

Often the simplest way to learn about a new technology is to work through some
tutorials.

You may already have worked your way through the
[getting started](../README.md) one.

For a much more in depth encounter with Qooxdoo, we have some comprehensive
tutorials:

- [**Qooxdoo tutorial app**](http://www.qooxdoo.org/qxl.tutorial)
  ([Code](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qxl.tutorial)): An interactive web app that teaches you how 
  to code with the Qooxdoo framework
