Tutorial Part 8: Unit Testing
===============================

In this tutorial, we'll be taking a closer look at qooxdoo's integrated unit testing framework. Armed with this new knowledge, we'll then define a few unit tests for the tweets application created in previous tutorials, generate the test runner application, and watch the tests in action. As usual, the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/tree/%{release_tag}/component/tutorials/tweets/step4.4).

Background
----------

qooxdoo's unit testing framework is similar to [JSUnit](http://www.jsunit.net/) but self-contained, so no external libraries are necessary. It consists of two main components:

The classes in the [qx.dev.unit](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit) namespace provide the interface against which tests are written and the infrastructure needed to run them. The `qxl.testtapper` package

Test class structure
--------------------

The actual test code is contained in classes living within the namespace of the tested application, located in the `source/class/<$APPLICATION>/test` directory by default. A fresh qooxdoo application skeleton (GUI, Inline or Native flavor) contains a simple test class named **DemoTest**:

```javascript
qx.Class.define("tweets.test.DemoTest", {
  extend : qx.dev.unit.TestCase,

  members : {
    /*
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    TESTS
    ----------------------------------------------------------*/
    /**
    * Here are some simple tests
    */
    testSimple : function() {
      this.assertEquals(4, 3+1, "This should never fail!");
      this.assertFalse(false, "Can false be true?!");
    },
    /**
    * Here are some more advanced tests
    */
    testAdvanced: function () {
      var a = 3;
      var b = a;
      this.assertIdentical(a, b, "A rose by any other name is still a rose");
      this.assertInRange(3, 1, 10, "You must be kidding, 3 can never be outside [1,10]!");
    }
  }
});
```

All test classes share the same basic structure:

-   They must inherit from [qx.dev.unit.TestCase](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit.TestCase)
-   Individual tests must be defined as member functions with names beginning with `test`. Apart from that, they can contain other member functions, properties and so on. Usually, test functions instantiate classes of the tested application, invoke their methods and compare the results with expected values.
-   Exceptions are used to communicate the test results back to the Testrunner. No exception means the test went fine, throwing any exception from the test method signals a failure. Return values from the test methods are not evaluated.

`qx.dev.unit.TestCase` includes the assertion functions from [qx.core.Assert](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{release_tag}/apiviewer/#qx.core.Assert). These can be used to check values, e.g. by comparing a tested method's return value to an expected value. If the assertion fails, a [qx.core.AssertionError](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{release_tag}/apiviewer/#qx.core.AssertionError) is thrown.

Building and running the tests
------------------------------

The [qxl.testtaper](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qxl.testtapper) package provides a simple test rig for executing all the test methods you added to your application.

```console
$ nqx qx package update
$ nqx qx package install qooxdoo/qxl.testtapper
```

Installing the `qxl.testtapper` package adds a new application to your `compile.json` file. The only thing you have to alter is to modify the `"myapp.test.*"` to point to load the `"tweet.test.*"` classes.

```json
{
  "class": "qxl.testtapper.Application",
  "name": "testtapper",
  "theme": "qx.theme.Simple",
  "title": "Qooxdoo TestTAPper",
  "environment": {
    "qx.icontheme": "Tango"
  },
  "include": [
    "tweets.tests.*"
  ]
}
```

Now start the server `nqx qx serve` and open <http://localhost:8080> in your bowser. You will now have the option to open the testtapper application.
The testtapper does not report any test details in the browser window (PRs welcome). It will instead output its results to the browser console.

The testtapper also includes a little node application that can execute the tests in 'puppeteer' which is a headless chrome browser, ideal for CI/CD applications.

```console
$ npm i puppeteer yargs nyc coveralls puppeteer-to-istanbul
$ node compiled/source/resource/qxl/testtapper/run.js http://localhost:8080/compiled/source/testtapper/
```

Creating a new test class
-------------------------

Now that we've got the basics covered, let's create some more meaningful tests for our tweets application, starting with the **tweets.TweetView** class. As you'll remember from the previous tutorials, it's responsible for displaying a single Tweet along with the user's icon. To this end, it has a property named `icon` with an apply method that sets the `source` property on the TweetView's `icon` child control. Our test will check if the `icon` property value is correctly applied to the icon widget. First of all, create a corresponding class **tweets.test.TweetView** in the `source/class/tweets/test` directory. (We won't be needing the DemoTest class any more, so feel free to delete it.)

```javascript
/**
  * @asset(tweets/logo.png)
  */
qx.Class.define("tweets.test.TweetView", {
  extend : qx.dev.unit.TestCase,

  members :
  {
    setUp : function()
    {
      this.__tweetView = new tweets.TweetView();
    },

    tearDown : function()
    {
      this.__tweetView.dispose();
      this.__tweetView = null;
    },

    testSetIcon : function()
    {
      var expectedSource = qx.util.ResourceManager.getInstance().toUri("logo.png");
      this.__tweetView.setIcon(expectedSource);
      var foundSource = this.__tweetView.getChildControl("icon").getSource();
      this.assertEquals(expectedSource, foundSource, "Icon source was not set correctly!");
    }
  }
});
```

Setting up and tearing down
---------------------------

Note the `setUp` and `tearDown` methods. Each test class can contain either or both (or none). setUp is called before each individual test function and is used to perform common initializations. Similarly, tearDown is called after each test method (even if the test failed), e.g. to dispose objects created by setUp or the test itself. Together, they can be used to make sure each test method runs in a "clean" environment: In this case, we create a new instance of the tested class for each test and dispose it afterwards, which is a very common pattern in unit testing.

The `tearDown` logic is actually quite an important part of developing unit tests since tests that don't clean up after themselves can lead to nasty dependencies where test B will pass when run individually but fail when run after test A. Singletons are particularly vulnerable since their state carries over between tests. So if, for example, test A checks how a class reacts to a locale change by calling `qx.locale.Manager.getInstance().setLocale` while test B relies on the locale still being the application's default, B would fail whenever A ran first.

For cases where the generic class-wide `tearDown` isn't enough, methods using the naming convention `tearDown<TestName>` can be defined. A method named e.g. `tearDownTestFoo` would be called after `testFoo` and the generic `tearDown` of the class were executed.

The test function
-----------------

We need the URI of a valid image for this test, so we add an `@asset` hint to the class header that will cause the Generator to add the file `source/class/tweets/resource/logo.png` to the AUT's resources. In the test function, we first ask qooxdoo's resource manager to resolve the resource ID into a valid URI. This is the expected value for the icon child control's `source` property. Next, we apply this value to the TweetView's `icon` property, then get the child control's `source` property and compare the two values using [assertEquals](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.core.Assert~assertEquals).

OK, time to build the AUT again. This time, run `generate.py test-source` instead of `test`. As you might expect, this will generate a source version of the AUT, which, like the source version of the actual application, is far better suited for development. Open the file `test/index-source.html` to load the Testrunner with the source tests.

Asynchronous Tests
------------------

As with many GUI applications, the various components of the tweets app use events to communicate. The `tweets.IdenticaService` class, for example, has a method `fetchTweets` that causes a `changeTweets` event to fire once the data store has finished (re)loading. We can't know in advance just how long this takes, so we need some way to instruct the test to wait until the event fires. This is where asynchronous testing comes in.

Once again, create a new test class named **tweets.test.IdenticaService**. The `setUp` and `tearDown` methods are mostly identical to the ones from tweets.test.TweetView, except of course they initialize/destroy an instance of tweets.IdenticaService instead. Here's the actual test function:

```javascript
testFetchTweets : function() {
  this.__identicaService.addListener("changeTweets", function() {
    this.resume();
  }, this);

  this.__identicaService.fetchTweets();
  this.wait(5000);
}
```

First, we register a listener for the `changeTweets` event. The callback function invokes the [resume](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit.TestCase~resume) method, which informs the Testrunner that the asynchronous test has finished. We could pass a function parameter to resume if, for example, we wanted to check the data associated with the `changeTweets` event, but for now we just want to verify that it fires at all.

Next, we invoke the `fetchTweets` method which should cause the event to fire.

Finally, the [wait](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit.TestCase~wait) method informs the Testrunner that it should wait for a `resume` call. The first argument is the amount of time to wait (in milliseconds) before the test is marked as failed. Note that wait **must** always be the last call in an asynchronous test function. Any code that follows it will never be executed.

Now, if you run this test a couple times in quick succession, there's a good chance it will at some point fail with the error message "Error in asynchronous test: resume() called before wait()". This is because due to the browser caching the result of the identica API request sent by TweetService, the `changeTweets` listener callback is executed immediately after calling fetchTweets. This is a common problem in asynchronous tests, encountered whenever the tested code's behavior can be synchronous or asynchronous depending on external factors. Luckily, there's a simple fix for it: We just wrap the problematic method call in a timeout to make sure it's executed after `wait()`:

```javascript
qx.event.Timer.once(function() {
  this.__identicaService.fetchTweets();
}, this, 100);
```

While we could use a simple `window.setTimeout` for this, it's preferable to use [Timer.once](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.event.Timer~once) since it uses qooxdoo's global error handling to catch and log any exceptions that might be thrown in the callback code. Otherwise, these would just land on the browser console.

Requirements
------------

Finally, let's take a quick look at test requirements \<pages/frame\_apps\_testrunner\#requirements\>. This is a way to define preconditions that must be satisfied before a test can be run. If a requirement isn't met, the test will be skipped (and marked as such in the Testrunner GUI). Common requirements are:

-   The test checks browser-specific behavior, so it should only be run in selected browsers
-   The tested class performs secure backend communication, so the test should only execute if the AUT was loaded over HTTPS

In order to use requirements, you need to include the Mixin [qx.dev.unit.MRequirements](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit.MRequirements) in your test class. Requirements are defined by calling the [require method](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit.MRequirements~require) with an array of requirement ID strings as the only parameter. Usually, this will be the first call in either a test function or the `setUp` method. Requirement IDs are evaluated by looking for a method name beginning with "has" followed by the requirement ID (starting with a capital letter) on the current test class and its ancestors. The method is called and its return value is checked: `true` means the requirement is met and the test can proceed, `false` means the test won't be executed and the Testrunner GUI will list it as "skipped".

While `qx.dev.unit.MRequirements` contains a number of `has` methods for common scenarios, requirements are often application-specific and so test developers will implement their own checks in the test class itself, a common base class or a mixin.

And that's it for a first look at unit testing for qooxdoo applications. Note that qooxdoo comes with a [wrapper](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit.MMock) for the powerful [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/) testing framework, which offers spies, stubs and mock objects that allow testing the very internals of a class, such as if and how many times a specific method was invoked. But that's a topic for a separate tutorial.
