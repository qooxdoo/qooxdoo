Grid
====

The grid layout manager arranges the items in a two dimensional grid. Widgets can be placed into the grid's cells and may span multiple rows and columns.

Features
--------

-   Flex values for rows and columns
-   Minimal and maximal column and row sizes
-   Manually setting of column and row sizes
-   Horizontal and vertical alignment
-   Horizontal and vertical spacing
-   Column and row spans
-   Auto-sizing

Description
-----------

The grid arranges the child widgets in a two dimensional grid. Each child is associated with a grid `column` and `row`. Widgets can span multiple cells by setting the `colSpan` and `rowSpan` layout properties. However each grid cell can only contain one widget. Thus child widgets can never overlap.

The grid computes the preferred with/height of each column/row based on the preferred size of the child widgets. The computed column widths and row heights can be overridden by explicitly setting them using [setColumnWidth](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.ui.layout.Grid~setColumnWidth) and [setRowHeight](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.ui.layout.Grid~setRowHeight). Minimum and maximum sizes for columns/rows can be set as well.

By default no column or row is stretched if the available space is larger/smaller than the needed space. To allow certain rows/columns to be stretched each row/column can have a flex \<pages/ui\_layouting\#flex\> value.

Layout properties
-----------------

-   **row** *(Integer)*: The row of the cell the widget should occupy. Each cell can only contain one widget. This layout property is mandatory.
-   **column** *(Integer)*: The column of the cell the widget should occupy. Each cell can only contain one widget. This layout property is mandatory.
-   **rowSpan** *(Integer)*: The number of rows, the widget should span, starting from the row specified in the `row` property. The cells in the spanned rows must be empty as well. (defaults to `1`)
-   **colSpan** *(Integer)*: The number of columns, the widget should span, starting from the column specified in the `column` property. The cells in the spanned columns must be empty as well. (defaults to `1`)
