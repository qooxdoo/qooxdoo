# Qooxdoo history

Qooxdoo has a long history. Originally developed by a dedicated
team at [1&1](https://www.1und1.de/), its version 0.1 is from [Mai
2005](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qooxdoo/files/qooxdoo-legacy/0.1/).
Up to version 2, qooxdoo was developed in a SVN repository
at sourceforge.net, were the source code for versions
[0.1-0.7](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qooxdoo/files/qooxdoo-legacy/) and
[1.0-5.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qooxdoo/files/qooxdoo-current/)
is archived. Since 2013, the Qooxdoo source code has moved to GitHub.

In 2015, the Qooxdoo was transformed to a open source project led by a team of
volunteer developers and managed by a foundation under Swiss law.
