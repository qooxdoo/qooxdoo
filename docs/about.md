About
=====

qooxdoo (pronounced ['kuksdu:]) is a universal JavaScript framework for creating enterprise grade single page web applications. With its class based objectorientation  qooxdoo allows to keep even the code of the most complex applications well organized and manageable. The integrated compiler produces single file applications ready for deployment.


Framework
---------

The qooxdoo framework enhances the javascript language with a full fledged class based oo system, including a powerful properties system and mixins. Qooxdoo is largely based on namespaces to allow for easy integration with other libraries and existing user code. It comes with a [comprehensive API reference](http://api.qooxdoo.org) that is auto-generated from Javadoc-like comments in the framework sourcecode.

Qooxdoo are written in plain javascript, no new syntax is introduced, all the extra functionality is realized through clever application of existing javascript abilities. In order to create an application that can be loaded by the browser, the qooxdoo source code has to be processed by the qooxdoo compiler.

The qooxdoo compilers is a node based application written in qooxdoo itself. It loads qooxdoo source code and adds all the required framework components necessary to create an application that is executable in the browser.

GUI Toolkit
-----------

Despite being a pure JavaScript framework, qooxdoo is on par with GUI toolkits for desktop application like Qt when it comes to advanced yet easy to implement user interfaces. It offers a full-blown set widgets that are hardly distinguishable from elements of native desktop applications. Full built-in support for keyboard navigation, focus and tab handling and drag & drop is provided. Dimensions can be specified as static, auto-sizing, stretching, percentage, weighted flex or min/max, or even as combinations of those. All widgets are based on powerful and flexible layout managers which are at the core of many of the advanced layout capabilities.

No HTML or CSS has to be used and augmented to define the interface. The qooxdoo developer does not even have to know CSS to style the interface. Clean and easy-to-configure themes for appearance, colors, borders, fonts and icons allow for complete themability.

Communication
-------------

While being a client-side and server-agnostic solution, the qooxdoo project includes different communication facilities, and supports low-level XMLHttpRequests (XHR) as well as an RPC API. An abstract transport layer supports queues, timeouts and implementations via XHR, Iframes and Scripts. Like the rest of qooxdoo it fully supports event-based programming which greatly simplifies asynchronous communication.


qooxdoo was originally developed by one of the world's leading web hosters 1&1 Internet (now part United Internet AG). In late 2015 the qooxdoo framework with all its assets was turned over to the qooxdoo association, located in Switzerland. Qooxdoo development has since then been lead by a group of dedicated developers congregating on [gitter](https://gitter.im/qooxdoo/qooxdoo) and [github](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo). Contributions are always welcome.
