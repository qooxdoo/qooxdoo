Table
=====

The table package contains classes that allow you to build up virtual tables for showing data in a grid like view.

Description
-----------

A `Table` is a widget to show a set of data in a column based view. It is based on the idea of virtual rendering. This means that only the visible rows will be rendered, which increases the performance of the widget and makes the table capable of displaying thousands of rows. But it is important to know that the table has only virtual rows, not columns. Having a huge number of columns can still decrease performance.

Features
--------

|Column Feature|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|Display grid data|Takes an array containing an array for each row. The data in the row can be of almost any type.|
|Set custom header|Pre-built header renderer for icons and labels. Can be easily extended to supply a custom header cell renderer.|
|Column sorting|Built-in sorting accessible to the user by a tap on the table header.|
|Reorganizing of columns|Columns can be reorganized by the user via Drag&Drop.|
|Change the visibility of columns|A special column visibility menu is included. It offers the user a way to show / hide single columns.|
|Content menu support|The table supports content menus for each cell.|
|Meta Columns|You can define one or more column which have a separate scrolling if any. E.g. you could have the first column always visible, while the other columns scroll out of view.|
|Resizable columns|The user can resize each column individually.|

|Row Feature||
|-----------|---|
|Render for different kinds of data types|Special renderer for boolean, dates, HTML content, numbers, passwords and strings.|
|Conditional rendering for individual table cells|A conditional renderer is available which can render the data in different ways dependent on the content, like applying a red text colors to negative numbers.|
|Row filtering|Filtering for specific data can be done with a filter method.|
|Virtual rendering for rows|Only the rows visible will be rendered which increases the speed of the table.|
|Highlight color for hovered row|The currently hovered row can be highlighted.|

|General Feature||
|---------------|---|
|Capable of remote data gathering|A remote data model can fetch data from the server. It fetches only the current visible data which means not the whole data needs to be transfered to the client on startup.|
|Different selection modes|The table offers single and multi selection in different variants.|
|Editable cells|The cells can be set to editable. Build in editors are CheckBox, ComboBox, PasswrodField, SelectBox and TextField.|
|Focus indicator|The currently selected cell can have a focus indicator.|
|Statusbar|The table has a status bar to show the number of rows and/or custom text.|

Examples
--------

### Simple

The most simple table can be build in five lines of code, as you can see in this example:

    // table model
    var tableModel = new qx.ui.table.model.Simple();
    tableModel.setColumns(["ID", "A number"]);
    tableModel.setData([[1, 12.23],[3, 849759438750],[2, -2]]);

    // table
    var table = new qx.ui.table.Table(tableModel);
    this.getRoot().add(table);

One of the important parts of the table is the table model. The first line creates a simple table model. In the second and third line, we configure the table model with some column names and data. With that model, we can create a table and add it to our application, as the example shows in the last two lines.

### Editable Column

Making for example the second column of our simple example editable can be done in one line:

    // make second column editable
    tableModel.setColumnEditable(1, true);

The first parameter here is the column (column numbering starts with 0), and the second one is to change the editable state.

### Sorting

Also adding a default sort order for the table is easy in one single line:

    // sort the table on startup
    tableModel.sortByColumn(0, true);

Again, the first argument is the column. The second argument is responsible for the sort order, `true` for ascending.

### Conditional Cell Rendering

As a last addition to our example we build something more complex. We want to render all negative numbers in red and all positive numbers in green:

    // conditional rendering
    var newRenderer = new qx.ui.table.cellrenderer.Conditional();
    newRenderer.addNumericCondition(">", 0, null, "green");
    newRenderer.addNumericCondition("<", 0, null, "red");
    table.getTableColumnModel().setDataCellRenderer(1, newRenderer);

For that purpose, qooxdoo has a built-in conditional renderer. In the first line, we create such a renderer. The second and third line set up our conditional rules. The last line tells the table column model to use that renderer for the column with the index 1.

UML Diagram

This diagram shows how the table uses the different kinds of classes you can find in the table namespace. The diagram is divided in two sides. The left side is interesting for the user if he wants to extend the table or wants to use its custom cell renderer for example. The right side is usually a set of internal classes the tables uses to get its general tasks done.
