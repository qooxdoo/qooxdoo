Features
--------

-   Auto sizing
-   Ellipsis: If the label does not fit into the widget bounds an ellipsis ("...") is rendered at the end of the label. (Only in text mode)
-   "height for width": If the widget's width is too small to display the text in one line the text is wrapped and a new size hint is calculated. (Only in HTML mode)
-   Configurable fonts, text colors and text alignment

Description
-----------

The Label supports two different modes. The text and the HTML mode. The mode can be set by using the `rich` property. Which mode to use depends on the required features. If possible the text mode should be preferred because in this mode the text size calculation is faster.
