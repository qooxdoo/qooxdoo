Description
-----------

The button is a classic GUI element, that supports two states: pressed and not pressed. The state is changed by a pointer (tap) or keyboard (enter or space) event. There is an additional third state when the tri-state mode is enabled. The third state means that the widget was neither pressed nor unpressed, i.e. the state of the button is undetermined.
