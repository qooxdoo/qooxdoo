The Apiviewer is an application to browse qooxdoo's class API. The tree view pane offers the typical class hierarchy, organized by name spaces. Each package (intermediate name space) has an overview description and links to the sub-packages or classes it contains. Descriptions usually contain cross links to relevant packages or classes. The entire reference is searchable through the search tab, where you can enter class and method names.

The actual API descriptions are generated from JSDoc-style comments in the class code, and can be generated for custom applications as well, so you can browse the API of your own classes in Apiviewer.
