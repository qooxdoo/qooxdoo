//THIS IS A TEMPLATE - ADAPT TO NEED

Mini application tests focus on visual aspects (showcase, widget browser). Overall they should be a lot less time-consuming than full tests. Details about the mini tests will be noted on the test sheets.

Unless otherwise noted, the latest stable version of each browser must be used.
