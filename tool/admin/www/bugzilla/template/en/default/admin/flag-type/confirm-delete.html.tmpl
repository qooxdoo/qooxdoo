[% PROCESS global/header.html.tmpl

<p>
  [% IF flag_type.flag_count %]
    There are [% flag_type.flag_count %] flags of type [% flag_type.name FILTER html %].
    If you delete this type, those flags will also be deleted.
  [% END %]

  Note that instead of deleting the type you can
   <a href="editflagtypes.cgi?action=deactivate&amp;id=[% flag_type.id %]&amp;token=
           [%- token FILTER html %]">deactivate it</a>,
   in which case the type [% IF flag_type.flag_count %] and its flags [% END %] will remain
   in the database but will not appear in the [% terms.Bugzilla %] UI.
