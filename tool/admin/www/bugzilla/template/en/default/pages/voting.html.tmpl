<p>[% terms.Bugzilla %] has a "voting" feature. Each product allows users to 
have a certain number of votes. (Some products may not allow any, which means 
you can't vote on things in those products at all.) With your vote, you 
indicate which [% terms.bugs %] you think are the most important and 
would like to see fixed. Note that voting is nowhere near as effective 
as providing a fix yourself.</p>

<p>Depending on how the administrator has configured the relevant product,
you may be able to vote for the same [% terms.bug %] more than once.
Remember that you have a limited number of votes. When weighted voting 
is allowed and a limited number of votes are available to you, you will 
have to decide whether you want to distribute your votes among a large 
number of [% terms.bugs %] indicating your minimal interest or focus on 
a few [% terms.bugs %] indicating your strong support for them.
</p>

<p>To look at votes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to the query page. Do a normal query, but enter 1 in the "At least
  ___ votes" field. This will show you items that match your query that
  have at least one vote.</li>
</ul>

<p>To vote for [% terms.abug %]:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bring up the [% terms.bug %] in question.</li>

  <li>Click on the "(vote)" link that appears on the right of the "Importance"
  fields. (If no such link appears, then voting may not be allowed in
  this [% terms.bug %]'s product.)</li>

  <li>Indicate how many votes you want to give this [% terms.bug %]. This page 
  also displays how many votes you've given to other [% terms.bugs %], so you 
  may rebalance your votes as necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will automatically get email notifying you of any changes that occur
on [% terms.bugs %] you vote for.</p>

<p>You may review your votes at any time by clicking on the "<a href=
"votes.cgi?action=show_user">My Votes</a>" link in the page footer.</p>
