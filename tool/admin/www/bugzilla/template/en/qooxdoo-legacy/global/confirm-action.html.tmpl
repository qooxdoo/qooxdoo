  [% IF reason == "expired_token" %]
    Your changes have been rejected because you exceeded the time limit
    of [% constants.MAX_TOKEN_AGE FILTER html %] days before submitting your
    changes to [% script_name FILTER html %]. Your page may have been displayed
    for too long, or old changes have been resubmitted by accident.

  [% ELSIF reason == "missing_token" %]
    It looks like you didn't come from the right page.
    One reason could be that you entered the URL in the address bar of your
    web browser directly, which should be safe. Another reason could be that
    you clicked on a URL which redirected you here <b>without your consent</b>.

  [% ELSIF reason == "invalid_token" %]
    You submitted changes to [% script_name FILTER html %] with an invalid
    token, which may indicate that someone tried to abuse you, for instance
    by making you click on a URL which redirected you here <b>without your
    consent</b>.
