  When marking [% terms.abug %] as a duplicate, the reporter of the duplicate
  is normally added to the CC list of the original. The permissions
  on [% orig_bug FILTER none %] (the original) are currently set
  such that the reporter would not normally be able to see it.

  <b>Adding the reporter to the CC list of [% orig_bug FILTER none %]

  [% END %]
  allow him/her access to view this [% terms.bug %].</b>
