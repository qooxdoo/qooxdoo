<div id="welcome-admin">
  <p>Welcome, [% user.identity FILTER html %].</p>

  <p>You are seeing this page because some of the core parameters have not been set up yet.
  The goal of this page is to inform you about the last steps required to set up
  your installation correctly.</p>

  <p>As an administrator, you have access to all administrative pages, accessible from
  the <a href="admin.cgi">Administration</a> link visible at the bottom of this page.
  This link will always be visible, on all pages. From there, you must visit at least
  the <a href="editparams.cgi">Parameters</a> page, from where you can set all important
  parameters for this installation; among others:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="editparams.cgi?section=core#urlbase">urlbase</a>, which is the URL
    pointing to this installation and which will be used in emails (which is also the
    reason you see this page: as long as this parameter is not set, you will see this
    page again and again).</li>

    <li><a href="editparams.cgi?section=core#cookiepath">cookiepath</a> is important
    for your browser to manage your cookies correctly.</li>

    <li><a href="editparams.cgi?section=general#maintainer">maintainer</a>,
      the person responsible for this installation if something is
      running wrongly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Also important are the following parameters:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="editparams.cgi?section=auth#requirelogin">requirelogin</a>, if turned
    on, will protect your installation from users having no account on this installation.
    In other words, users who are not explicitly authenticated with a valid account
    cannot see any data. This is what you want if you want to keep your data private.</li>

    <li><a href="editparams.cgi?section=auth#createemailregexp">createemailregexp</a>
    defines which users are allowed to create an account on this installation. If set
    to ".*" (the default), everybody is free to create his own account. If set to
    "@mycompany.com$", only users having an account @mycompany.com will be allowed to
    create an account. If left blank, users will not be able to create accounts themselves;
    only an administrator will be able to create one for them. If you want a private
    installation, you must absolutely set this parameter to something different from
    the default.</li>

    <li><a href="editparams.cgi?section=mta#mail_delivery_method">mail_delivery_method</a>
    defines the method used to send emails, such as sendmail or SMTP. You have to set
    it correctly to send emails.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    After having set up all this, we recommend looking at [% terms.Bugzilla %]'s other
    parameters as well at some time so that you understand what they do and whether you
    want to modify their settings for your installation.
  </p>
