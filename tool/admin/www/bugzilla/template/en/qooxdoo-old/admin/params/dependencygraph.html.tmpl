                     A complete file path to 'dot' (part of

                     generate the graphs locally.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     A URL prefix pointing to an installation of the
                     <a href=\"http://www.research.att.com/~north/cgi-bin/webdot.cgi\">webdot
                     package</a> will generate the graphs remotely.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     A blank value will disable dependency graphing.
                   </li>
                 </ul>
                 The default value is a publicly-accessible webdot server. If you change
                 this value, make certain that the webdot server can read files from your
                 webdot directory. On Apache you do this by editing the .htaccess file,
                 for other systems the needed measures may vary. You can run checksetup.pl
                 to recreate the .htaccess file if it has been lost."}
