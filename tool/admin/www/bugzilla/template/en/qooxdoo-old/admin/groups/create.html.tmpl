<p><b>Name</b> is what is used with the B<!-- blah -->ugzilla->user->in_group()
function in any customized cgi files you write that use a given group.
It can also be used by people submitting [% terms.bugs %] by email to
limit [% terms.abug %] to a certain set of groups.</p>

<p><b>Description</b> is what will be shown in the [% terms.bug %] reports
to members of the group where they can choose whether
the [% terms.bug %] will be restricted to others in the same group.</p>

<p>The <b>Use For [% terms.Bugs %]</b> flag determines whether or not the
group is eligible to be used for [% terms.bugs %]. If you clear this, it will
no longer be possible for users to add [% terms.bugs %] to this group,
although [% terms.bugs %] already in the group will remain in the group.
Doing so is a much less drastic way to stop a group from growing
than deleting the group would be. <b>Note: If you are creating
a group, you probably want it to be usable for [% terms.bugs %], in which
case you should leave this checked.</b></p>

<p><b>User RegExp</b> is optional, and if filled in, will 
automatically grant membership to this group to anyone with an 
email address that matches this regular expression.</p>

<p>
  <b>Icon URL</b> is optional, and is the URL pointing to the icon
  used to identify the group. It may be either a relative URL to the base URL
  of this installation or an absolute URL. This icon will be displayed
  in comments in [% terms.bugs %] besides the name of the author of comments.
</p>

<p>By default, the new group will be associated with existing 
products. Unchecking the "Insert new group into all existing 
products" option will prevent this and make the group become 
visible only when its controls have been added to a product.</p>
