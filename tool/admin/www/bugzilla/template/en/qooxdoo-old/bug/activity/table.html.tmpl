  # operations: array of hashes. May be empty. Each has has three members:
  #   who: string. who performed the operation
  #   when: string. when they performed it
  #   changes: hash. Details of what they changed. This hash has three
  #            compulsory and one optional member:
  #     field: string. The name of the field
  #     removed: string. What was removed from the field
  #     added: string. What was added to the field
  #     attach_id: integer. If the change was adding an attachment, its id.
  # incomplete_data: boolean. True if some of the data is incomplete (because
  #                  it was affected by an old Bugzilla bug.)

  <p>
    There used to be an issue in <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>
    which caused activity data to be lost if there were a large number of cc's
    or dependencies.  That has been fixed, but some data was already lost in
    your activity table that could not be regenerated.  The changes that the
    script could not reliably determine are prefixed by '?'.
