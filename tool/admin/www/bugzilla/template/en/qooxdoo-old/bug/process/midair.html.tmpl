[%# INTERFACE:
  # operations: array; bug activity since the user last displayed the bug form,
  #   used by bug/activity/table.html.tmpl to display recent changes that will
  #   be overwritten if the user submits these changes.  See that template
  #   for further documentation.
  # start_at: number; the comment at which show/comments.tmpl should begin
  #   displaying comments, either the index of the last comment (if the user
  #   entered a comment along with their change) or a number less than that
  #   (if they didn't), in which case no comments are displayed.
  # comments: array; all the comments on the bug.
  # bug: Bugzilla::Bug; the bug being changed.
