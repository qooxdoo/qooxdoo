[%# This template is a place to put directives that should get processed
  # every time a primary template gets processed.  Primary templates are those
  # called from Perl code rather than from other templates via the PROCESS
  # and INCLUDE directives.
  #
  # This template gets auto-processed at the beginning of primary templates
  # via the PRE_PROCESS configuration parameter.  Note that it gets processed
  # for non-HTML templates too, so don't put HTML-specific stuff in here;
  # put that into header.html.tmpl instead.
