[% INCLUDE global/header.html.tmpl title = "sudo: User Impersonation" %]

<p>
  [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] includes the ability to have one user impersonate 
another, in something called a <i>sudo session</i>, so long as the person 
doing the impersonating has the appropriate privileges.
</p>

<p>
  While a session is in progress, [% terms.Bugzilla %] will act as if the 
  impersonated user is doing everything.  This is especially useful for testing,
  and for doing critical work when the impersonated user is unavailable.  The 
  impersonated user will receive an email from [% terms.Bugzilla %] when the 
  session begins; they will not be told anything else.
</p>

<p>
  To use this feature, you must be a member of the appropriate group.  The group 
  includes all administrators by default.  Other users, and members of other 
  groups, can be given access to this feature on a case-by-case basis.  To 
  request access, contact the maintainer of this installation: 
  <a href="mailto:[% Param("maintainer") %]">
  [%- Param("maintainer") %]</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you would like to be protected from impersonation, you should contact the 
  maintainer of this installation to see if that is possible.  People with 
  access to this feature are protected automatically.
