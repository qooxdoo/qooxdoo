/**
 * A page is a widget which provides a screen with which users
 * can interact in order to do something. Most times a page provides a single task
 * or a group of related tasks.
 *
 * A qooxdoo mobile application is usually composed of one or more loosely bound
 * pages. Typically there is one page that presents the "main" view.
 *
 * Pages can have one or more child widgets from the {@link qx.ui.mobile}
 * namespace. Normally a page provides a {@link qx.ui.mobile.navigationbar.NavigationBar}
 * for the navigation between pages.
 *
 * To navigate between two pages, just call the {@link #show} method of the page
 * that should be shown. Depending on the used page manager a page transition will be animated.
 * There are several animations available. Have
 * a look at the {@link qx.ui.mobile.page.Manager} manager or {@link qx.ui.mobile.layout.Card} card layout for more information.
 *
 * A page has predefined lifecycle methods that get called by the used page manager
 * when a page gets shown. Each time another page is requested to be shown the currently shown page
 * is stopped. The other page, will be, if shown for the first time, initialized and started
 * afterwards. For all called lifecycle methods an event is fired.
 *
 * Call of the {@link #show} method triggers the following lifecycle methods:
 *
 * * <strong>initialize</strong>: Initializes the page to show
 * * <strong>start</strong>: Gets called when the page to show is started
 * * <strong>stop</strong>:  Stops the current page
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Define all child widgets of a page when the {@link #initialize} lifecycle
 * method is called, either by listening to the {@link #initialize} event or overriding
 * the {@link #_initialize} method. This is because a page can be instanced during
 * application startup and would then decrease performance when the widgets would be
 * added during constructor call. The <code>initialize</code> event and the
 * {@link #_initialize} lifecycle method are only called when the page is shown
 * for the first time.
