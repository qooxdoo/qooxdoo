/**
 * The tree package contains classes that allow you to build up visual
 * trees, like the ones you are familiar with e.g. for browsing your file
 * system. Such a tree behaves like a tree control in your application, with the
 * usual properties like borders, background or scrollbars. Expanding
 * and collapsing tree nodes is handled automatically by showing or hiding the
 * contained subtree structure.
 *
 * To construct a tree, start up with the {@link qx.ui.tree.Tree Tree} class,
 * then use {@link qx.ui.tree.TreeFolder TreeFolder} and {@link
 * qx.ui.tree.TreeFile TreeFile} objects to populate your tree.
